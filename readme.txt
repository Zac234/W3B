Now that we understand some of the layout based HTML tags and CSS rules, let's try to build a simple site that creates a more complicated layout.

Use your projectStarter script to create a project named "W3B"
Connect your folder to Git/GitHub
Using HTML and CSS create the following with grid

This is a standard header, main footer site.
See if you can break down each section into a grid to get the desired layout
Feel free to add whatever real content you want for the actual logo and articles
The middle cards can each be an article (which can each be their own grid)
Note: Do not worry about any screen size other than desktop (don't worry about phone or tablet sized screens, just make it work on your screen)
Add, commit with the message "Added multi-column layout" and push your simple site to GitHub
To submit, please enter the URL for your new repository.
